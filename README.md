# Face Detection Project

This project uses OpenCV to detect faces in images. It utilizes a Haar Cascade Classifier which is a popular method for object detection.

## Project Structure

- `face_detection.py` - The main Python script that performs face detection.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` - Haar Cascade XML file for detecting faces.
- `images/` - Directory containing images on which face detection will be performed.
- `README.md` - This file, describing the project and how to use it.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system along with the following packages:
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install these packages using pip:
